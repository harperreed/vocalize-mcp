# üéôÔ∏è VocalizeAgent - Text-to-Speech MCP Server üó£Ô∏è

[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-harperreed-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/harperreed)

A powerful MCP server that provides text-to-speech capabilities with emotion control and voice customization. Perfect for AI agents that need to express themselves with human-like voice characteristics.

## üìã Summary

VocalizeAgent is an MCP (Machine Conversation Protocol) server that enables AI agents to speak text aloud with emotional expression. Built with support for multiple TTS engines (pyttsx3, gTTS, and ElevenLabs), it offers:

- üé≠ Six emotion categories: cheerful, dramatic, friendly, professional, playful, and calm
- üéõÔ∏è Full control over voice selection, speaking rate, and emotional tone
- üéØ Multiple TTS engines: pyttsx3 (offline), gTTS (online with accents), ElevenLabs (AI voices)
- üîÑ Automatic fallback when optional dependencies or API keys are not available
- üìö Comprehensive documentation for effective voice emoting
- ü§ñ Simple but powerful API for AI agents to vocalize their responses

This tool enhances AI interactions by adding an audio dimension to text-based communications, making digital assistants more engaging, expressive, and human-like.

## üöÄ How to Use

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/harperreed/vocalize-mcp.git
cd vocalize-mcp

# Install with uv (recommended) - full installation with all engines
uv sync

# OR install simple version (pyttsx3 only)
uv sync --only-deps simple

# OR install with pip
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .                    # Full installation
pip install -e .[simple]           # Simple installation (pyttsx3 only)
```

### TTS Engine Selection

Control which TTS engine to use with the `TTS_ENGINE` environment variable:

```bash
# Use pyttsx3 (default, offline)
TTS_ENGINE=pyttsx3 uv run python main.py

# Use gTTS (online, requires --extra gtts)
TTS_ENGINE=gtts uv run python main.py

# Use ElevenLabs (AI voices, requires --extra elevenlabs and API key)
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here TTS_ENGINE=elevenlabs uv run python main.py
```

**Engine Features:**

- **pyttsx3**: Offline engine with system voices and rate control
- **gTTS**: Online Google TTS with accent variations for emotions
- **ElevenLabs**: AI-powered voices with advanced emotional control

### ElevenLabs Configuration

For ElevenLabs engine, set these environment variables:

```bash
export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
export ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID="JBFqnCBsd6RMkjVDRZzb"  # Optional, defaults to George
```

**Or create a `.env` file** (automatically loaded):

```bash
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=JBFqnCBsd6RMkjVDRZzb
```

- Get your API key from [ElevenLabs Dashboard](https://elevenlabs.io/app/speech-synthesis)
- Voice IDs can be found in your ElevenLabs voice library
- Uses the `eleven_flash_v2_5` model for fast, high-quality synthesis
- Environment variables override `.env` file values

## üîß Technical Information

### Dependencies

- **Python**: 3.13+
- **uv**: Fast Python package manager (recommended) - [Install uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- **MCP**: Machine Conversation Protocol for AI agent integration
- **pyttsx3**: Cross-platform text-to-speech library (included by default)
- **gTTS**: Google Text-to-Speech (included by default)
- **pygame**: Audio playback for gTTS and ElevenLabs (included by default)
- **elevenlabs**: ElevenLabs AI voices (included by default)
- **python-dotenv**: Environment variable loading (included by default)

### Why uv?

This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management because it's:

- ‚ö° **10-100x faster** than pip for installing packages
- üîí **Reliable** with deterministic dependency resolution
- üõ†Ô∏è **Simple** with built-in virtual environment management
- üì¶ **Compatible** with standard Python packaging

### Architecture

VocalizeAgent is built on a FastMCP server that exposes TTS functionality through simple API calls. The system:

1. **Multi-engine support**: Dynamically selects TTS engine based on environment variable
2. **Graceful fallback**: Automatically falls back to pyttsx3 when gTTS is not available
3. **Emotion mapping**: Maps emotions to appropriate voices (pyttsx3) or accents (gTTS)
4. **Voice organization**: Organizes voices into emotional categories for easier selection
5. **Rate adjustment**: Adjusts speaking rates based on emotional context
6. **Discovery tools**: Provides tools for voice discovery and documentation
7. **Exception handling**: Handles errors gracefully for robust operation
