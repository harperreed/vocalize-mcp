## Project Notes

Successfully implemented multi-engine TTS support for vocalize-mcp project. Key technical insights:

1. Environment variable pattern: Using TTS_ENGINE env var for runtime engine selection is clean and flexible
2. Optional dependencies in pyproject.toml: Using [project.optional-dependencies] with extras like [gtts] provides clean separation
3. Graceful fallback architecture: The pattern of trying preferred engine first, then falling back with logging warnings worked well
4. Import pattern for optional deps: The try/except import block with GTTS_AVAILABLE flag is a solid pattern for optional features
5. Engine abstraction: Created separate _speak_with_pyttsx3() and _speak_with_gtts() functions to keep engine-specific logic isolated
6. gTTS creative solution: Used different English accents (UK, AU, CA, US) to simulate emotional variety since gTTS doesn't have multiple voices
7. Cleanup handling: Both engines needed different cleanup approaches (engine.stop() vs pygame.mixer.quit())

The architecture scales well - could easily add more TTS engines in the future by following the same pattern. The testing showed both engines work correctly and fallback behavior is robust.
