## Project Notes

Great suggestion from Harper to use python-dotenv! Much cleaner than manual env var handling. Key implementation notes:

1. Added python-dotenv as core dependency (not optional) since it's lightweight and universally useful
2. Called load_dotenv() early in main.py to automatically load .env file
3. Fixed ElevenLabs API usage - needed to import from elevenlabs.client and use .text_to_speech.convert() method
4. ElevenLabs API returns generator that needs b"".join() to convert to bytes
5. Updated test to properly validate actual engine usage vs fallback behavior

Test improvements were crucial:
- Now checks main.TTS_ENGINE matches requested engine
- Validates response message contains correct engine name  
- Fails test when fallback occurs instead of false positive

ElevenLabs API working correctly now:
- Uses eleven_flash_v2_5 model as requested
- Proper voice settings mapping for emotions
- Real API calls happening (saw HTTP request in logs)
- Audio generation and playback working

The .env file approach is much more user-friendly than requiring manual export commands.
