## Project Notes

Successfully added ElevenLabs as third TTS engine option. Key technical implementation notes:

1. ElevenLabs API integration: Used elevenlabs-python SDK with eleven_flash_v2_5 model for speed/quality balance
2. Voice settings mapping: Mapped emotions to specific VoiceSettings parameters (stability, similarity_boost, style, use_speaker_boost)
3. API key management: Required ELEVENLABS_API_KEY env var with graceful fallback to pyttsx3 when missing
4. Voice ID configuration: ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID env var with sensible default (George voice)
5. Audio playback: Reused pygame mixer system for consistency with gTTS implementation
6. Temporary file handling: Same pattern as gTTS - save to temp file, play, cleanup
7. Error handling: Proper exception handling with fallback chain

Emotional voice settings chosen based on ElevenLabs best practices:
- Dramatic: Low stability (0.3), high style (0.9) for expressive variation
- Calm: High stability (0.9), low style (0.2) for consistent soothing tone
- Professional: High stability (0.8), low style (0.3) for clear authoritative delivery
- Friendly: Medium values (0.7/0.6) for balanced warm tone
- Playful: Low stability (0.4), high style (0.8) for fun variation

The three-engine architecture (pyttsx3 → gTTS → ElevenLabs) provides good coverage:
- Offline fallback (pyttsx3)
- Free online option (gTTS) 
- Premium AI option (ElevenLabs)

Testing confirmed all engines work and fall back properly when dependencies/keys missing.
